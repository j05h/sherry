The URL sharing thingie.

So, you want to share URLs quickly between devices. Put the 'share' and 'go' links in your browser bars. If you click on the 'share' link, the current page you're on will be shared. On whichever device you click 'go', you'll go to the last shared link.

Pretty simple really.

* Throw away all the code and replace with bit.ly backend.
